# Project Overview: Zap Programming Language
Zap is a programming language designed specifically for game and game engine development, drawing inspiration from Nim's syntax and compilation model while incorporating functional programming concepts. The language emphasizes fine-grained control over memory management while maintaining developer ergonomics.

## Current Implementation Status

The Zap compiler has made significant progress in establishing a robust compilation pipeline. The current implementation includes several key components that work together to process Zap source code and generate executable programs.

### Compiler Pipeline

The compiler now features a complete pipeline from source code to executable output. The pipeline includes lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, IR conversion, and code generation. Each stage has been implemented with proper error handling and type safety.

The recent addition of the IR conversion layer provides a clean separation between our high-level AST and low-level code generation. This intermediate representation facilitates future optimization passes and ensures type safety throughout the compilation process.

### Core Features

The language currently supports:

Basic Expressions:
- String literals with proper handling of escape sequences
- Print statements for program output
- Block expressions with proper scope management
- Break statements with label validation
- Result expressions for block return values
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with type checking

Type System:
- Multiple numeric types (Int32, Int64, Float32, Float64) 
- Vector types with SIMD alignment
- Structured data with proper field access
- Array types with bounds checking
- Basic type inference and checking
- Type safety for binary operations

Memory Management:
- Stack allocation for simple types
- Arena-based allocation for complex data structures
- Scope-based resource management
- Memory leak detection during compilation

### Testing Infrastructure

The project now includes comprehensive test suites for various compiler components:
- Unit tests for lexical analysis and parsing
- Type system validation tests
- IR conversion verification
- Memory allocation analysis tests

## Development Roadmap

The following areas should be prioritized for future development:

### 1. Complete End-to-End Testing

While we have made progress in testing individual components, we need to implement comprehensive end-to-end tests that verify the entire compilation pipeline. This includes:
- Performance benchmarking infrastructure
- Test coverage for error conditions and edge cases

### 2. Expression Support Enhancement

The IR conversion layer needs to be expanded to support more expression types:
- Variable declarations and assignments
- Function calls and definitions
- Control flow structures (if/else, loops)
- Pattern matching capabilities

### 3. Optimization Implementation

With our IR structure in place, we can begin implementing optimization passes:
- Constant folding and propagation
- Dead code elimination
- SIMD operation optimization
- Memory access optimization
- Basic block optimization

### 4. Memory Management Improvements

The memory management system needs additional features:
- Lifetime analysis for arena allocations
- Automatic resource cleanup
- Memory pool optimization
- Stack allocation optimization

### 5. Error Handling and Recovery

Error handling can be improved in several areas:
- More detailed error messages
- Error recovery during parsing
- Suggestions for fixing common errors
- Better location information in error messages

### Recent Progress

The compiler has recently gained support for:
- Complete block expression handling with proper scope management
- Type-safe binary arithmetic operations
- Improved error handling for type mismatches
- Enhanced test coverage for expression handling

### Current Development Status

Work is currently underway to implement control flow structures, starting with if/else expressions. The initial test case has been written to verify proper handling of conditional expressions with boolean conditions and type-safe branches. This will serve as the foundation for implementing more complex control flow structures.

### Next Steps

The immediate priorities for continuing development are:

1. Complete the if/else expression implementation:
   - Implement IR conversion for conditional expressions
   - Add semantic analysis for boolean conditions
   - Verify type consistency between branches

2. Expand control flow support:
   - Add loop constructs
   - Implement pattern matching
   - Add error handling constructs

3. Continue enhancing the test suite with:
   - Additional test cases for control flow
   - Integration tests for combined features
   - Error handling test cases

## Documentation Status

The codebase maintains inline documentation for all major components. Future work should include:
- API documentation for public interfaces
- User guide for language features
- Developer guide for compiler internals
- Example programs demonstrating language features

This living document should be updated as new features are implemented and project priorities evolve.
