# Project Overview: Zap Programming Language

Zap is a programming language designed specifically for game and game engine development, drawing inspiration from Nim's syntax and compilation model while incorporating functional programming concepts. The language emphasizes fine-grained control over memory management while maintaining developer ergonomics.

## Current Implementation Status

The Zap compiler has made significant progress in several key areas. The compilation pipeline now includes robust type checking and semantic analysis capabilities, with particular attention paid to function handling and vector operations.

### Recently Completed Features

The semantic analysis phase now supports:
- Comprehensive function declaration and call validation
- Type checking for function parameters and return values
- Block expression analysis with proper scope handling
- Vector operations with type safety
- Basic vector field access checking

The type system has been enhanced to handle:
- Function types with parameter and return type validation
- Vector types with dimension and component type checking
- Block expression type inference
- Print statement type validation

### Test Infrastructure

The project maintains a comprehensive test suite covering:
- Semantic analysis tests for functions, blocks, and vector operations
- Integration tests for end-to-end compilation scenarios
- Type checking tests for composite types
- Error handling and recovery tests

### Next Development Priority

The immediate focus should be on implementing SIMD optimization for vector operations. This includes:

1. Implementing the C code generation for vector operations:
   - Vector addition using SIMD instructions
   - Dot product operations
   - Component-wise operations
   - Vector component access

2. Enhancing the IR to represent vector operations efficiently:
   - Adding SIMD-specific IR nodes
   - Implementing vector operation lowering
   - Optimizing vector component access

3. Adding optimization passes for vector operations:
   - SIMD instruction selection
   - Vector operation fusion
   - Memory alignment optimization

The groundwork for this implementation is already in place with the semantic analysis supporting vector operations. The next step is to ensure these operations are efficiently compiled to SIMD instructions.

### Current Limitations

The current implementation has the following limitations that should be addressed:
- Vector operations are type-checked but not yet optimized for SIMD
- Field access is limited to vector components
- The dot product operation is defined in the AST but not yet implemented in the code generator

### Development Strategy

For implementing SIMD optimization, follow these steps:

1. Extend the C code generation module to output SIMD intrinsics
2. Add IR transformations to identify vectorization opportunities
3. Implement vector operation optimization passes
4. Add comprehensive tests for SIMD code generation

The existing test suite provides a strong foundation for these changes. New tests should be added for each SIMD optimization feature as it is implemented.

This documentation will be updated as new features are implemented and project priorities evolve.
